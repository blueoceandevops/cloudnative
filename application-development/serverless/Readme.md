# Serverless

Serverless is an event-driven application architecture that abstracts infrastructure resources and enables teams to focus on writing code. Applications are implemented as groups of loosely coupled functions, and these functions are deployed and invoked for the user by the platform. Resources are automatically scaled up and down without the user needing to worry about host provisioning, maintenance, and other infrastructure concerns.
