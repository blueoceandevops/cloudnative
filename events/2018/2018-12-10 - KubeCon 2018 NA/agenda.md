## 10:00am - 10:45am Cloud Native Past, Present, Future

Hear from community leaders, end users, and open source contributors as they
discuss the state of our cloud native ecosystem. They will delve into
milestones of our evolution, what's driving key technology choices today, and
how innovation is being defined for the future. These influencers will hash out
what's at stake and distill what really matters.

## 11:00am - 11:45am Converging infrastructure and container orchestration with Kubernetes

Kubernetes and its model for container orchestration has won the battle, but
when it comes to managing our infrastructure we reach for our old tools and
methodologies. Given Kubernetes' flexibility and extensibility, why aren't we
using it to orchestrate more than just containers? In this talk, we'll cover
our tooling to simplify orchestrating infrastructure by leveraging Kubernetes
Custom Resource Defintions and Controller/Operator patterns to achieve:

  * Resilience: make your infrastructure resilient by declaring it inside an
      active control plane with continuous monitoring and reconciliation
      against a desired state
  * Scale: optimize the management and provisioning speed of large and complex
      infrastructure compositions by using model-event-driven approach
  * Simplicity: simplify the user experience when managing infrastructure by
      using your favorite Kubernetes tooling like kubectl, helm, ksonnet,
      kustomize and many others, they're not just for containers
  * Extensibility: extend the automation by leveraging the operator pattern for
      non-containerized applications and platforms

## 12:45pm - 1:30pm Serverless and Events Ecosystem

The CNCF Serverless Working Group is a subgroup of the Cloud Native Computing
Foundation created to explore the intersection of cloud native and serverless
technology. The group has since created a whitepaper laying out the definitions
of serverless computing and its use cases, a landscape doc with the ecosystem
of players, as well as its first major contribution back to the community with
CloudEvents, a vendor-neutral specification for defining the format of event
data.  In this talk, Chad Arimura, VP Serverless Advocacy at Oracle, will share
the latest updates from the working group, demonstrate CloudEvents through a
code demo, introduce the next areas of work being discussed by the group, and
ideally convince you, the audience, the get involved in the community-driven
efforts.

## 2:00pm - 2:45pm Kubernetes service delivery at scale without magic: a FaaS case study

Sift through the hype of Kubernetes to learn how to build a cloud scale
Functions-as-a-Service using the open source Fn Project. In this talk we'll
cover being able to identify the key requirements for your service, how to
translate those requirements into useful Kubernetes abstractions, understanding
the availability and blast radius for your service, when and when not to lean
into Kubernetes, and how to leverage Helm for deployments and rollbacks.

## 3:30pm - 4:15pm Cloud Native Java: Not your grandfather's Cup of Joe

Java has evolved in the last year; a 6-month release cadence, and powerful new
features. In this talk we will give a birds-eye view of how Java has evolved
and present Helidon, a new framework to build microservices for a cloud native
world. Helidon includes powerful hooks for Prometheus and distributed tracing
libraries such as Zipkin. We will show how Helidon goes hand in hand with
Oracle's Cloud Native Platform, showcasing how to build, deploy and operate a
cloud native Java application using this powerful new framework.
