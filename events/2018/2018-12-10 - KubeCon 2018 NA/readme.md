## The Cloud Native Culture & Industry Summit

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Presented by Oracle</h3>

Join some of the industry's top cloud native minds for a concentrated dose of
technical talks paired with hands-on learning.

We'll host an innovator's panel, cover all things serverless, including the Fn
Project, how to extend Kubernetes to ease application development, how to
deploy secure, agile microservices on top of Kubernetes, and much more.

You won't want to miss the Cloud Native Past, Present, and Future panel as it's
chock full of your favorite practitioners, innovators, and maintainers
including Kris Nova, Ashley McNamara, John Harris, and more. They will delve
into milestones of our evolution, what's driving key technology choices today,
and how innovation is being defined for the future. These influencers will hash
out what's at stake and distill what really matters.

Hear from the creator of the Fn Project, the container-native serverless
platform, and former Co-Founder and CEO of Iron.IO, Chad Arimura, and from an
HPC Fn user, Christopher Woods who is pushing the boundaries of compute with
open source.

The former Co-Founder of OneOps, now Cloud Architect at Oracle leading design
and implementation of a distributed application management system, will share
his team's latest open sourced tooling for creating a fully autonomous modern
application development framework.
