In September of 2017, Kubernetes introduced Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims in alpha. The Persistent Volume features came about in response to a variety of use cases and asks in the community around persistent storage. As of November 2018, these features are in beta, (with various sub-features still in alpha) so they are still relatively new and still developing.  There could be some changes to them before they reach their first official release, but they can still be useful for experimenting, and understanding the concepts Kubernetes is going for in terms of Persistent Storage.
It's useful to explain these concepts in terms of their use. In the case of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, we can explore using the Persistent Volume features via Oracle Cloud Infrastructure's open source plugins: the OCI FlexVolume Driver, and the OCI Volume Provisioner.
The general concepts in the following sections should be applicable in various environments. We'll focus on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as a concrete example.
