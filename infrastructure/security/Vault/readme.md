Secret management is one of the core use cases for Vault. Vault enables organizations to secure, store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, encryption keys for protecting secrets, and other sensitive data using a UI, CLI, or HTTP API. Many organizations have credentials hard coded in source code, littered throughout configuration files and configuration management tools, and stored in plaintext in version control, wikis, and shared volumes. Vault provides a central place to store these credentials, ensuring they are encrypted, and that access is audit logged and exposed only to authorized clients.

Vault provides a wide array of features across secrets management, data protecton, identity-based access, collaboration and operations, and governance and compliance.

Vault tightly controls access to secrets and encryption keys by authenticating against trusted sources of identity such as Active Directory, LDAP, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms. Vault enables fine grained authorization, permitting users and applications access to secrets and keys.

### Prerequisites
 - You will need to have deployed your OKE Kubernetes cluster prior to commencing implementation of the deployment scenario. Follow the link to [this tutorial](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/oci/oke-full/index.html) for guidance on the process.
 - Create a 'kube config' authentication artifact. This will be used later in the tutorial to connect to the OKE cluster. Follow the link to [this tutorial](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/oci/oke-full/index.html#DownloadthekubeconfigFilefortheCluster) for guidance on the process.
 - Install the Vault CLI on the host from which you will be following this work instruction. Follow the link to [this tutorial](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started/install) for guidance on the process.
