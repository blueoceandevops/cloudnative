# Kafka

Apache Kafka is an extremely popular distributed streaming platform, used for solving a variety of problems not limited to pub-sub messaging, metric/log aggregation and processing, or event management. World-class, open source projects use Kafka for streaming messages or even data storage, such as [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash).

In this series of tutorials, we'll talk about using Kafka in your production environments, from basic quickstarts to advanced management and war stories!
